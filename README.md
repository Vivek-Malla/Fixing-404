# Fixing-404

Dear Fixing 404 team members,

I am excited to welcome you all to this hackathon and I'm looking forward to working with each of you. As our team name suggests, our goal is to find solutions to those pesky 404 errors that can be frustrating for users and website owners alike.

Together, we bring a diverse set of skills and experiences to the table, including expertise in coding, design, project management, and problem-solving. I believe that we have the potential to create something truly innovative and impactful.

Let's collaborate, communicate openly, and challenge each other to bring our best to this hackathon. With hard work and dedication, I'm confident that we can develop a solution that will make a difference.

Best regards,
Vivek Malla
